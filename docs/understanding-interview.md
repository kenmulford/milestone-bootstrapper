# The understanding-interview engine

The reusable procedure that captures what Claude must know about a project and
records it into the project docs (`.project/`). This is **Job 1** of the
bootstrapper — the understanding layer that every later tool grounds in
([BRIEF.md:28-41](../BRIEF.md)).

This document is the **engine**, not a user-facing command and not the
orchestration. It is invoked *by* the `plan` skill (#9) and reconciled *by* the
`apply` / `update` skills (#13/#14). They own the surface, the plan file, and the
writes; this engine owns the interview and the recording discipline that fills
the doc sections.

## 1. The interview pattern

Mirror the driver setup's Phase-2 tier-by-tier confirmation
([milestone-driver setup SKILL.md:50-67](../../milestone-driver/skills/setup/SKILL.md),
non-negotiables :235-237). The shape is identical; only the captured material
differs (project understanding here, profile keys there).

Present capture fields **grouped by concern**, one field or logical group at a
time. For every field:

| Step | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Label** | State a plain-language label for what is being captured. |
| **Default** | Show a detected default **or** an illustrative example — **never a blank prompt**. (Non-negotiable: [SKILL.md:235](../../milestone-driver/skills/setup/SKILL.md).) |
| **Choice** | Accept · edit · skip. Never leave a field set without an explicit choice. |
| **Skip consequence** | On any skippable field, state the consequence on the same line — what stays `[TBD]` 🔴 and which downstream lens loses grounding. (Non-negotiable: [SKILL.md:236](../../milestone-driver/skills/setup/SKILL.md).) |
| **Atomicity** | Never write a partial result. Either a tier's fields are resolved (captured / "none" / explicitly skipped to `[TBD]` 🔴) or nothing for that tier is written. (Non-negotiable: [SKILL.md:237](../../milestone-driver/skills/setup/SKILL.md).) |

The detected default is *soft-coupled* to stack detection (#7/#3): when detection
is available, seed the default from it; when it is not, fall back to an
illustrative example. Either way the prompt is never blank — that is the
load-bearing rule, not the source of the default.

### Tier order (group by concern)

| Tier | Captures | Target doc(s) |
|---|---|---|
| **1 · Goal & vision** | What the project is for; what it optimizes for. | `design-philosophy.md` |
| **2 · Architecture** | Architectural stance, layering, boundaries. | `design-philosophy.md` |
| **3 · Technology stack** | Language + version, framework, SQL flavor + ORM, major libraries. | `library-manifest.md` + `environment.md` |
| **4 · Environment model** | Data stores + test-data isolation, caching, async/messaging, external services, deployment targets. | `environment.md` |
| **5 · Mandated packages** | Libraries/tooling required by purpose (distinct from what detection finds). | `library-manifest.md` |
| **6 · Versioning policy** | SemVer yes/no, version-file location, bump cadence. | `conventions.md` |
| **7 · Design system** *(UI projects only)* | Tokens, components, layout, required states, a11y, voice. | `design-system.md` + `tokens.json` |

Skip Tier 7 entirely for a repo with no UI surface — an all-`[TBD]`
`design-system.md` is the correct "no design-lens grounding" signal
(`design-system.md` header comment), so leaving it untouched is *recording*, not
omission.

## 2. The capture-field → section map (fixed)

This map is **fixed** — taken verbatim from [BRIEF.md:32-39](../BRIEF.md) and the
template `##` anchors. The engine does **not** choose where an answer goes; it
records each captured field under the stable anchor named here. Each anchor was
read from `project-docs/templates/` and is a citation target — never rename one
(§3).

The five doc templates expose **29** `##` anchors total
(`design-philosophy.md` 6 · `library-manifest.md` 4 · `environment.md` 7 ·
`conventions.md` 6 · `design-system.md` 6). Every anchor below appears exactly
once.

### `design-philosophy.md` (6 anchors) — Tiers 1-2

| Capture field | `##` anchor |
|---|---|
| Goal & vision: what kind of system, what it optimizes for | `## Architectural stance` |
| Architecture: layers and allowed dependency directions | `## Layering & boundaries` |
| Goal & vision: ranked priorities and explicit non-goals | `## What we optimize for` |
| Architecture: irreversible decisions needing human sign-off | `## One-way doors` |
| Architecture: fail-open/closed, error policy, logging | `## Error & failure philosophy` |
| Goal & vision: what is tested, at what level, "verified" bar | `## Testing philosophy` |

### `library-manifest.md` (4 anchors) — Tiers 3, 5

| Capture field | `##` anchor |
|---|---|
| Stack: platform/runtime + primary frameworks **with versions** | `## Runtime & frameworks` |
| Stack + mandated packages: one approved choice per purpose (table) | `## Approved libraries (by purpose)` |
| Mandated packages: where dependency proposals go (the PAUSE gate) | `## Adding a dependency (the gate)` |
| Mandated packages: libraries explicitly not to use, and why | `## Avoid / banned` |

### `environment.md` (7 anchors) — Tiers 3-4

| Capture field | `##` anchor |
|---|---|
| Environment: which environments exist and how they differ | `## Environments` |
| Environment: data stores, topology, **test-data isolation** (biggest drift source) | `## Data stores` |
| Environment: caching tech + invalidation, or **"none"** | `## Caching` |
| Environment: background jobs / queues / streams, or "none" | `## Async & messaging` |
| Environment: third-party services (auth, payments, email, storage, APIs) | `## External services & integrations` |
| Stack/environment: where it runs, runtime/version targets | `## Runtime & hosting` |
| Environment: where the app deploys — hosting vendor/platform/target (record, don't provision) | `## Deployment targets` |

### `conventions.md` (6 anchors) — Tier 6 (+ stack-derived conventions)

| Capture field | `##` anchor |
|---|---|
| Stack-derived: file/type/function/test/branch naming | `## Naming` |
| Stack-derived: where things go, the shape of a feature | `## File & folder layout` |
| Stack-derived: where tests live, naming, fixtures, a good test | `## Test patterns` |
| Stack-derived: reference implementations to mirror (table, `path:line`) | `## Canonical exemplars (mirror these)` |
| Stack-derived: commit message format + PR expectations | `## Commits & PRs` |
| Versioning policy: SemVer y/n, version-file location, bump cadence | `## Versioning` |

### `design-system.md` (6 anchors) — Tier 7 (UI projects only)

| Capture field | `##` anchor |
|---|---|
| Design tokens: color/type/spacing/radius intent (source of truth `tokens.json`) | `## Design tokens` |
| Canonical components and where they live (table) | `## Component inventory` |
| Grid, breakpoints, spacing rhythm, density | `## Layout & responsive rules` |
| Empty / Loading / Error / Disabled states (bullet list) | `## Required states` |
| Contrast, focus, target size, semantics standard | `## Accessibility baseline` |
| Tone for labels, errors, empty states | `## Voice & microcopy` |

`tokens.json` is the machine-readable companion to `## Design tokens`: record
real values over its `[TBD]` cells with the same discipline; an untouched `[TBD]`
token reads as unspecified (file header comment).

> **Best-practice adherence is load-bearing** ([BRIEF.md:35](../BRIEF.md)).

## 3. Recording discipline

Three rules govern how a captured answer lands in a doc. They are the whole
consistency mechanism — get them exactly right.

### 3.1 Replace the placeholder under a stable heading — never rename the heading

Each `##` heading carries a placeholder beneath it: a `> [TBD] — …` blockquote, a
table row of `[TBD]` cells, or (in `## Required states`) `[TBD]` bullets. Record
the answer by **replacing the placeholder content under the heading**.

**Never rename, reword, or reorder a `##` heading.** Headings are citation
anchors — downstream tools cite `.project/<file>.md#<section>`, so a renamed
heading silently breaks every citation
([project-docs templates header comments](../project-docs/templates/design-philosophy.md);
SPEC.md §4.1). Add a *new* section only by appending, never by renaming an
existing one.

### 3.2 The three states — `captured` vs `none` vs `[TBD]` 🔴 (never collapse them)

There are three distinct, recorded states. They are **not** interchangeable
([SPEC.md §4.3, lines 163-176](../SPEC.md); [BRIEF.md:30](../BRIEF.md)).

| State | What it means | How it is recorded |
|---|---|---|
| **`captured`** | The user supplied a real answer. | The answer replaces the placeholder. Plain text, no 🔴. |
| **`none`** | The user said **"None" / "not yet" / "not applicable"** — a *real, deliberate* answer that a thing does not exist (e.g. "no caching", "no async jobs"). | Record the word **"None"** (or the user's exact phrasing) as the answer. **No 🔴.** It is a captured decision, not an unknown. |
| **`[TBD]` 🔴** | A **genuine unknown** the interview could not resolve and the user could not supply. | Leave the `[TBD]` placeholder in place and flag it 🔴. Never fabricate a value to fill it. |

> [!WARNING]
> **Never collapse `none` into `[TBD]`.** A recorded "None" for caching is the
> safe, drift-preventing answer — it tells every downstream issue "there is no
> cache, do not invent one." A `[TBD]` means "unknown — a human must decide."
> Mapping a user's "None" to `[TBD]` (or vice-versa) corrupts the project's
> understanding. "None" is *captured*; `[TBD]` is *open*.

A `[TBD]` section is always the **safe representation of "not specified"**
([SPEC.md §4.3](../SPEC.md); [BRIEF.md:30,66](../BRIEF.md)): downstream tools
treat a `[TBD]` anchor as "not specified" and fall back to inferred repo
convention rather than grounding on a placeholder (template header comments). So
a genuine unknown left as flagged `[TBD]` is correct and safe — never a reason to
guess.

### 3.3 Skip → `[TBD]` 🔴 with its consequence

A skipped field becomes a flagged `[TBD]` 🔴, and the skip prompt must have
already stated the consequence (§1). Skipping is legitimate; it is *not* the same
as recording "none" — skip = "unknown, deferred to a human", none = "the user
answered that it does not exist."

---

## 4. Output style

Honor the suite's shared output style
([BRIEF.md:80](../BRIEF.md); [milestone-driver setup SKILL.md:231](../../milestone-driver/skills/setup/SKILL.md)):

- **Concise and tabular.** Report captures as tables, not walls of prose.
- **🔴 on every flagged `[TBD]`.** Any anchor left as a genuine unknown is marked
  for a human.
- **🔴 on the versioning-target caveat.** When versioning is captured for a
  **non-plugin repo** and the version file is unresolved, flag it: the driver's
  bump target is `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` today, so a non-plugin version file
  may need the driver's target generalized ([BRIEF.md:38](../BRIEF.md);
  [SPEC.md §4.3 / version-file row](../SPEC.md)). Record this as a `[TBD]` 🔴, not
  a silent assumption.

---

## 5. Done — what this engine hands back

A set of **populated** `.project/` doc sections: real captured understanding
under stable anchors, deliberate "None" answers recorded as real answers, and
only genuine unknowns left as flagged `[TBD]` 🔴 ([BRIEF.md:41,66](../BRIEF.md)).
The engine writes no configs, provisions nothing, and runs no orchestration —
`plan` / `apply` / `update` (#9/#13/#14) and the config writer (#7) consume this
output from here.
